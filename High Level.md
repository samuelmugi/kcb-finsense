Here's a high-level design for your Spring Boot application that manages a collection of books with a RESTful API, including CRUD operations, data storage in an H2 in-memory database, and basic authentication.

### 1. **Architecture Overview**

**Layers:**
- **Controller Layer:** Handles HTTP requests and maps them to service calls.
- **Service Layer:** Contains business logic and interacts with the repository.
- **Repository Layer:** Manages data access and interactions with the database.
- **Entity Layer:** Represents the data model (Book entity).
- **Database Layer:** Stores book data in an H2 in-memory database.

### 2. **Component Breakdown**

#### a. **Book Entity (Model Layer)**
- **Class:** `Book`
- **Fields:**
    - `Long id`: Primary key, auto-generated.
    - `String title`: Title of the book (cannot be empty).
    - `String author`: Author of the book (cannot be empty).
    - `int year`: Year of publication.

- **Annotations:**
    - `@Entity`: Marks this as a JPA entity.
    - `@Id`: Marks the primary key.
    - `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)`: Auto-generates the ID.
    - `@NotBlank`: Validates that `title` and `author` are not empty.

#### b. **BookRepository (Repository Layer)**
- **Interface:** `BookRepository`
- **Extends:** `JpaRepository<Book, Long>`
- **Responsibilities:** Provides CRUD operations on the `Book` entity.

#### c. **BookService (Service Layer)**
- **Class:** `BookService`
- **Methods:**
    - `List<Book> getAllBooks()`: Retrieves all books.
    - `Optional<Book> getBookById(Long id)`: Retrieves a book by ID.
    - `Book createBook(Book book)`: Creates a new book.
    - `Book updateBook(Long id, Book book)`: Updates an existing book by ID.
    - `void deleteBook(Long id)`: Deletes a book by ID.

- **Dependency:** Injects `BookRepository` using `@Autowired`.

#### d. **BookController (Controller Layer)**
- **Class:** `BookController`
- **Endpoints:**
    - `POST /books`: Creates a new book.
    - `GET /books`: Retrieves all books.
    - `GET /books/{id}`: Retrieves a specific book by ID.
    - `PUT /books/{id}`: Updates a specific book by ID.
    - `DELETE /books/{id}`: Deletes a specific book by ID.

- **Dependency:** Injects `BookService` using `@Autowired`.

#### e. **Security Configuration**
- **Class:** `SecurityConfig`
- **Responsibilities:** Configures basic authentication.
- **Details:**
    - Enables HTTP Basic Authentication.
    - Secures all endpoints, requiring authentication.
    - Configures an in-memory user store with roles.

#### f. **Database Configuration**
- **Configuration File:** `application.yml`
- **Details:**
    - Configures the H2 in-memory database.
    - Enables H2 console for easy access during development.
    - Uses JPA and Hibernate to manage database interactions.

### 3. **Data Flow**

1. **Client Request:** A client sends an HTTP request to one of the REST endpoints (e.g., POST /books).
2. **Controller Layer:** The `BookController` receives the request, validates the input, and calls the corresponding service method.
3. **Service Layer:** The `BookService` processes the request, interacts with the `BookRepository` to perform the necessary CRUD operations, and returns the result.
4. **Repository Layer:** The `BookRepository` interacts with the H2 database, executing the necessary SQL queries (handled by Spring Data JPA).
5. **Response:** The `BookService` returns the processed data to the `BookController`, which then sends the appropriate HTTP response back to the client.

### 4. **Technology Stack**

- **Backend Framework:** Spring Boot
- **Data Access:** Spring Data JPA
- **Database:** H2 in-memory database
- **Security:** Spring Security with HTTP Basic Authentication
- **Validation:** JSR-303/JSR-380 Bean Validation (e.g., using `@NotBlank`)
- **Build Tool:** Maven or Gradle

### 5. **Deployment Considerations**

- **Development Environment:** The H2 database is suitable for development and testing environments.
- **Production Consideration:** For production, you may switch to a persistent database like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
- **Scalability:** The architecture supports easy scaling by adding more endpoints or services as needed.

### 6. **Example Use Cases**

- **Creating a Book:** The user submits a POST request with book details to `/books`, the application validates the input, creates a new record in the H2 database, and returns a success message.
- **Retrieving Books:** The user sends a GET request to `/books`, and the application retrieves and returns a list of all books in the database.
- **Updating a Book:** The user sends a PUT request to `/books/{id}`, the application updates the corresponding book's information in the database, and returns the updated details.
- **Deleting a Book:** The user sends a DELETE request to `/books/{id}`, the application deletes the book from the database and returns a confirmation message.

This high-level design should help guide the development of your Spring Boot application, ensuring a clean, maintainable, and scalable architecture.
